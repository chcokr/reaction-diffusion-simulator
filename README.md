This project belongs to Duke University's [Benfey
Laboratory](http://sites.duke.edu/benfey/).

This project contains tools that help you simulate a [reaction-diffusion
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionâ€“diffusion_system) over a growing
spatial domain.

## Mathematical formulation of the problem

Given a spatial domain growth function
![l(t) = l_0 + vt](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?l%28t%29%20%3D%20l_0%20&plus;%20vt),
solve the following system of PDEs for
![a(t,x)](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a%28t%2Cx%29)
and
![h(t,x)](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h%28t%2Cx%29)
over the time domain
![0 \leq t \leq T](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?0%20%5Cleq%20t%20%5Cleq%20T)
and over the spatial domain
![x\in \{0\leq x \leq l(t) \ | \ 0 \leq t \leq T\}](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%5Cin%20%5C%7B0%5Cleq%20x%20%5Cleq%20l%28t%29%20%5C%20%7C%20%5C%200%20%5Cleq%20t%20%5Cleq%20T%5C%7D).

## Mathematical rigor

This project implements a mathematically rigorous solver for the aforementioned
system of PDEs.
Since the spatial domain of this PDE system keeps growing, a theoretically
sound treatment of these PDEs requires a mathematical trick underneath.
For more information, please see [the dedicated documentation](./math.md).

## How to use this software

### [step 0] Setup

**Important note:** We've tested this project only on MATLAB R2015b on OS X
Yosemite.
Everything from here on assumes you're following on the same setup.

Alright, of course the very first thing you have to do is downloading this
project.
If you know what `git clone` is, do it.
If you don't, look for a `Download ZIP` button somewhere on this page (use
`cmd+F`) - click on it and unzip the downloaded file.

Now open up MATLAB.
Click on this icon:
<img width="534" alt="screen shot 2015-12-03 at 6 07 45 am" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3670967/11559096/75543d3a-9984-11e5-9f92-b22e59c9adff.png">
Navigate to the cloned/unzipped folder you downloaded.
There should be a directory called `src`.
Go inside `src`.
Once you're there, click `Open` in the bottom right corner of the window.

You're ready to start generating some figures!

### [step 1] `preview`

In the MATLAB Command Window, type `preview`.
Wait 5-10 seconds.
You'll get two nice 3D figures.
These are rough sketches of the solutions of
![a(t,x)](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a%28t%2Cx%29)
and
![h(t,x)](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h%28t%2Cx%29)
given the configuration in the `src/settings` directory (we'll go over how to
customize these settings later).

What do we mean by "rough sketches"?
The `preview` command's goal is to ***quickly*** return a low-resolution
solution using big mesh steps (as you can see in the resulting 3D figures).
So don't be surprised if you notice some nonsense - for example, negative
concentration values.
Such erroneous outcomes are because of the big mesh steps.
Keep in mind that we're sacrificing precision for speed.
So with the `preview` command, you can quickly prototype how your new PDEs might
turn out.

If the results of `preview` seem interesting and you want to more thoroughly
simulate your current configuration, you should move on to the next command:
`refine`.

### [step 2] `refine`

In the MATLAB Command Window, type `refine`.
Wait ~1 min.
Yes, `refine` takes longer than `preview` - this time, we're sacrificing speed
for precision.
So always try to strike a mental balance between how often you use `preview` and
how often you use `refine`.

**Caching:** Another thing about `refine`, in comparison to `preview`, is that
the results of `refine` given the current configuration in `src/settings` are
***cached***.
Since the `refine` command is slow, it would get really annoying if you have to
wait a couple of minutes every time, right?

Whenever the content of any file in the `settings` directory changes, `refine`
will start a fresh computation and not read from the cache.

In contrast, `preview` doesn't cache.
It runs so fast that there is no point caching the results.

Enough about caching...
So say you look at the resulting 3D figures and you like them.
You're pretty confident that your current configuration in `settings` is good.
But what if you want an animated visualization of how
![a](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a)
and
![h](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h)
diffuse across the spatial domain over time?
That's where the next command comes in: `animate`.

### [step 3] `animate`

In the MATLAB Command Window, type `animate`.
This command will read in the current solutions from the cache, and will start
generating a movie.
You can watch the frames being generated on the go.
Also, in the Command Window, there will be a message telling you how many more
frames need to be generated.

As you can sense, `animate` is a ***really slow*** command.
So only run it when you're absolutely confident about the results of `refine` -
don't waste your time :)

When the whole generation is done, a movie file will be saved to the parent
directory of `src`.
Go there and find it!
The file should be marked with a timestamp.
